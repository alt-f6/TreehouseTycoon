# Treehouse Tycoon 🌳🎈

**Genre:** 2-3 player Roblox survival-tycoon  
**Core idea:** Build and upgrade a massive tree-house club, earn **Leaves** (in-game currency), invite friends to connect branches, and take part in seasonal events.

---

## Gameplay Loop 🚀
1. **Build** an attraction → automatic Leaf income starts ticking.  
2. **Upgrade** it → higher income, faster timer.  
3. **Unlock** higher branches → new rooms & challenges.  
4. **Decorate** with furniture, skins, and pet beds.  
5. **Compete** in leaderboards: *Tallest Tree* & *Coziest Club*.
